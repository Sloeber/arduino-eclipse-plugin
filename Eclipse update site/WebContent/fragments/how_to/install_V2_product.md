This page contains Detailed instructions on how to install the Arduino Eclipse version 2 product.
===

This is the most advised installation.  
If you are not sure what you want to install please see the 
[install advice page]("install_advice.shtml").

WINDOWS USERS BE AWARE
====

 1. From Arduino IDE 1.5.6 make is no longer part of the Arduino IDE.  
 2. Moreover the [toolchain delivered as part of Arduino IDE contains a bug.](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/2422)  
As such we do not advise to Arduino IDE 1.5.6 or later on windows.  
Mac and linux normally come with make preinstalled and do not suffer the bug.
 3. In windows unpack is a 2 step process. I use 7Zip to uncompress and then I use 7Zip to unpak the tar file.
