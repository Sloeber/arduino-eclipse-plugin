Below is a decision flowchart that points to the version we advise to install.

**Which version**

Now you know what to install you still need to find out the "version" you need.  
In general the nightly build is stable. There is more risk but it is also more feature rich.   
So in general we advise to use the nightly build as soon as you "got used to the tool".  

Some things to consider if you do not use the nightly:
The product points to the nightly update site "out of the box". This means that -if you installed product 2.2- once you run a update you will be on the nightly track.   
If you do not want this behavior you will have to change the update site repository in eclipse. 

As jantje does not earn money with this plugin so he can get upset and annoyed if an issue is reported that has been fixed in a later version. As you are smart you know you do not want to play with an angry bear, do'nt you?

We do not advise to use the nightly of arduino. You may have a really good reason to do so and it will probably work but you are on the bleeding edge. If you do not know which Arduino IDE version to pick we do advice to use the latest released version unless we know it has issues. 

**issues we know of**  
We have gone through some issues with Arduino IDE 1.5.x and the mac platform. These issues have been fixed.  
Now we are going through some issues with Arduino IDE 1.5.x and the windows platform. In general on windows don't use version 1.5.7 or 1.5.8(at time of writing the latest version).  
For all platforms: If you don't need Arduino IDE 1.5.5 (and why would you?) stay away from it.  
From Arduino IDE 1.5.7 onwards the Make utility is no longer part of the Arduino IDE delivery. Look at your platform specific info to see how best to handle the situation.
