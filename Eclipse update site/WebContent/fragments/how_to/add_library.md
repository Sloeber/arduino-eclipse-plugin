How to add a library - Arduino Eclipse Plugin!
=====

Part of the power of arduino is the multitude of libraries available to the users. It is very easy to import a library into your project.  
Select the project you want the library to add to. In the main menu select "Arduino->add a library to the selected project".  
A dialog box will pop up showing all available libraries.

Note: that in contrast to the arduino IDE you will still need to add the include directives to your ino file.  
Note: from march 2015 there is no more subsections (hardware/arduino/library) Al libraries are sorted alphabetically.
