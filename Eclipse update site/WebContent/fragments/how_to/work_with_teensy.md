How to configure for Teensy
===========================

Working with Teensy and the Eclipse plugin is possible but asks some work.

*trippylighting* (a very nice guy) has done some very good documentation on how to use the Teensy boards with the Arduino Eclipse plugin.

Please see [his website](http://trippylighting.com/teensy-arduino-ect/arduino-eclipse-plugin/) for all Teensy related stuff.
