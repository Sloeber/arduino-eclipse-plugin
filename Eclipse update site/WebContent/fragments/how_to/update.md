How to update your plugin  
=========================

This update procedure works for all versions of the product.  

When you are in Eclipse select `Help` -> `Check for updates`: the procedure will check for any available update for your Eclipse installation, including eclipse, egit, CDT, the Arduino Eclipse plugin and many more.

Please **do not** download the new product version but use the update process via the update sites.

V1 users note there will never be an update.

Product users note that with recent versions you will update to the nightly build. If you do not want that remove the nightly build from your update sites.

After this do the **after update actions**

 How to the arduino version  
========================= 
Install the arduino IDE as you would do usually.  
After this do the **after update actions**

after update actions
==================
I'm not saying these steps should be done after each and every upgrade. However if something does not seem to work these are the first steps to do.

In the general preferences make sure you point to the "correct" arduino IDE.  
**Select apply and close.**

For each and every project go to the project properties->arduino. Verify your settings.  **Select apply and close.**

Note that it is not "abnormal" that after a update the data in the preferences->arduino or project properties-arduino is completely wrong.
