Context sensitive coloring 
========
The newer versions of the arduino IDE support quite a bit of context sensitive coloring. as you can see on this image

However there is far more support in the arduino eclipse plugin (that is : in CDT)

and far more flexibility to change it to your needs. Below is the arduino eclipse plugin with arduino look alike Context sensitive. After fiddling a bit in the preferences.

Well.... I didn't go as far as making the defines look as bad as in the Arduino IDE.  
And to be fair. This is a simple example. More complex stuff may not look so alike. But hey it does show it is far more powerfull than the possibilities offered by the arduino IDE.
