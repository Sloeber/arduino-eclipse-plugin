Arduino code
====
In the arduino IDE the arduino code is hidden away from you. As a beginner that is a good thing because you would not understand the code and may change things by accident and never recover.  

The arduino eclipse plugin does not protect you against that. The code is available at your finger tips like your own code. Your project contains an arduino folder with the subfolder core containing the arduino code that will be used to build your sketch.  

If you change the code you have changed the code delivered to you by arduino. Watch out. There is no protection whatsoever. If you feel this is scary make the files read only in your OS. At least you will get a warning.
