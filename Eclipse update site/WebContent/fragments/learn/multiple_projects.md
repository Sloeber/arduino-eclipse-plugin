Multiple projects
===
In the arduino IDE you are working on 1 sketch.  
In the arduino eclipse plugin you have a workspace and that workspace contains al your sketches (and other projects) together.  
Suppose you have a arduino Yun. On that Yun you have arduino code but you also wrote some web pages, a ash script and some Python.  
You can have all that in 1 workspace with the arduino eclipse plugin to edit arduino code an ash plugin to edit your bash file and a Python plugin to edit your Python code.  
This allows for easier version control and modifying sender and receiver in one single place.
