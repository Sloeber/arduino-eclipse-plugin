<h1>So you think Jantje did a great job? Well you are right. </h1>
<p >But; what do YOU want Jantje to do next with the plugin?</p>
Remove the need to have arduino.h in your source files.
Support for PDE/INO (So you do not have to add function declarations)
Possibility to select an example when creating a new sketch
Changing the com port from the toolbar
Changing the board from the toolbar
Adding scope functionality
Support for multi language
Option to put the console in front after build or upload request
Option to build before upload
Adding the assembler to version 2
Internationalisation (Allow for other people to add other languages at the gui level)
another idea
Jantje
