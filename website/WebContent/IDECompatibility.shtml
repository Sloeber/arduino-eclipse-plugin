		<h1>Keeping the eclipse project compatible with the IDE</h1>
		The compatibility between the arduino IDE and the arduino eclipse
		plugin can only be guaranteed from the Arduino Eclipse Plugin to the
		Arduino IDE and not the other way around. Currently the arduino
		eclipse plugin is out of the box not compatible with the Arduino IDE.
		The incompatibility is caused by the fact that the arduino eclipse
		plugin works with C++ files only. The arduino IDE can handle C++ files
		but needs at least one ino/PDE file (for amongst others) to identify
		the classpath.<br> 
		To be able to compile your code directly in
		the Arduino IDE you need to do something extra at three common actions
		during Arduino code development<br /> 
		1) After installation tell Eclipse to process ino(and/or pde) files like C++ file<br /> 2) After
		creation of a new sketch project rename the created cpp file to ino
		(or pde if you are using a Arduino IDE version below 1.0) <br> 
		3)After inclusion of a library add an include of the library to the ino
		file (Do not include it in a header file but in the ino directly.).<br>
		That is all which is needed to be done to create project that are
		Arduino IDE compatible.<br> 
		When you want to compile the project
		in the Arduino IDE select file open. Goto the Eclipse workspace
		folder. In the workspace folder there is a subfolder with your project
		name. In that subfolder you will find the .cpp file you renamed to
		.ide or .ino. Select that file and compile.<br>


		<h2>And here are detailed instructions on how to do this</h2>
		<h3>After installation tell Eclipse to process ino like C++ file</h3>
		In the menu select Windows -&gt;preferences <br /> In the section
		C/C++ -&gt; file types press new <br /> enter *.pde and or *.ino as
		filename and C++Source file as type.<br />
		<h3>After creation of a new sketch rename cpp file to pde</h3>
		Right click the .cpp file created by the new arduino sketch wizard<br />
		select rename<br /> change the .cpp to .ino or .pde
		<h3>After inclusion of a library add an include reference to the
			library to the ino or pde file.</h3>
		In the ino file at the top add a line that looks like<br /> #include
		&lt; [the imported library].h &gt; <br />
