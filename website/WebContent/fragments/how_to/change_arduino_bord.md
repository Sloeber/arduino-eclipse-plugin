Change your Arduino board settings
===

Once you have your sketch you may wonder: "I entered my board information in the sketch creation wizard but how can I change it?"  
It is actually easy:  
Right click on the project and select properties.    
In properties select Arduino.  
Here you can change your Arduino settings.  
The dialog looks pretty much like the one in the sketch creation wizard.
