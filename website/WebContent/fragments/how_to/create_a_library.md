How to create a library with the Arduino Eclipse plugin.
==

As you have a real development environment now which allows you to modify libraries as if they are part of your code you may wonder: "how can I make my own libraries?"    

The way I do it is a multiple step process as you can see below.  

**start by having a project**  
For sake of this demo I created a empty workspace and created a sketch in there. Here is what it looks like:

**write your first version of the library code**  
In most cases you will start by simply creating a class (right click the folder and select new class) inside a existing project.  
Later you will decide that this class/code is worth to be upgraded to a library.    
So we create a class in our project.    

**Create a subfolder with the library name in you private library folder**    
Don't put any files there, just create the folder.  
On my system I created a folder in /home/jan/Arduino/libraries with the name Libcodeclass. Note that it is a good practise to have the same name for the folder as for the header file (that is even with casing).    

**Import the library in your project**  
Because we created a folder the plugin can add the folder to the project.  
select the Arduino item in the menu->import an Arduino library.  
![Add the library to your project](http://iloapp.baeyens.it/data/_gallery/public/6/141814162245895400_resized.png)    
now your project should look something like:  
![a empty library folder](http://iloapp.baeyens.it/data/_gallery/public/6/141814162454370900_resized.png)  
Note that the Libcodeclass folder under libraries is empty.  
Also not the small arrow in the folder icon which indicates this is a linked folder.  

**Drag and drop the class to the library folder**  
Now simply drag and drop the header file and source code to the library folder.  
![we are done](http://iloapp.baeyens.it/data/_gallery/public/6/141814162408665500_resized.png)    
That is all there is to it.  

Note that you can just as well create the class in the Libcodeclass folder in eclipse. However in most cases you will promote existing code to a library.
