Change your Arduino port settings
===

Once you have your sketch you may wonder: "I entered my board information in the sketch creation wizard but how can I change it?"  
It is in the same dialog as in the change your board settings. Please see that section.  

For Teensy users only.
----
Teensy does not use the serial port for upload but it is still important to set the port right.  
This becomes apparent when you start using the serial monitor. Because the plugin closes the port and reopens the port during a upload it needs to have the right com port.    
Not having set the right port will result in serial port madness.  
You have been warned!!
