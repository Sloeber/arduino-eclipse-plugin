This page contains Detailed instructions on how to install the Arduino Eclipse version 2 product.
===

This is the most advised installation.  
If you are not sure what you want to install please see the 
[install advice page]("install_advice.shtml").

WINDOWS USERS BE AWARE
====
From Arduino IDE 1.5.6 make is no longer part of the Arduino IDE.  
[Watch this movie to see how to fix.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cspLbTqBi7k)  
Moreover the [toolchain delivered as part of Arduino IDE contains a bug.](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/2422)    
As such we do not advise to Arduino IDE 1.5.6 till 6.1 on windows.  Advised is 1.6.5.  
In windows unpack is a 2 step process. I use 7Zip to uncompress and then I use 7Zip to unpak the tar file.

Mac and linux
====
Mac and linux normally come with make preinstalled and do not suffer from the windows bug.
