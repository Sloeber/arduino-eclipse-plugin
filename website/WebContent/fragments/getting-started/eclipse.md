Eclipse
=======
Eclipse is a open source, platform independent, graphical environment based on Java.
It originated as an IDE (integrated development environment) but today it is more an extensible framework for rich client applications. 

The biggest advantage of Eclipse is that is supports (via plugins) all kinds of development. For instance I do web/lua/Arduino/bash development in the same project using the same version control tool.
