Overview
========
On the left you can see the main components that are needed for running Sloeber.

Fortunately you do not need to install all these components separately.
For instance in V2 the toolchain and avrdude come with the Arduino IDE. In V3 tSloeber downloads them for you.

If you install the C/C++ version of Eclipse you get Eclipse and Eclipse CDT plugin in 1 package.

If you install the product you get eclipse, Eclipse CDT plugin and Sloeber in 1 compressed file.

Warnings
========
Windows users using V2 must read the make section.
