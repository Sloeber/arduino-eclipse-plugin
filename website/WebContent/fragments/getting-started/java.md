Java 
====
Java is a platform independent interpreted language. This means that once you have built a Java program, the program can only run inside a Java interpreter, also known as the *Java Runtime*.

Java runtimes have been written for Windows, Linux and Mac. As such Java is called platform independent.

Older versions of the plugin were happy with Java 6. Currently Java 7 or above is needed and you're safer installing the SDK package which includes the Java Runtime. 
Most people have multiple versions of the Java Runtime on their machine: don't get too concerned about this.

Eclipse uses Java and so does the Arduino IDE.

To get any flavor of Java visit the [Oracle web site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or use your OS package manager.

Mac users
=========
Apple used to deliver it's own flavor of Java, but that's no longer the case. Install Java from the [Oracle web site](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) like everybody else.
