Toolchain
====
The toolchain is the compiler linker and archiver that make you C/C++ code a hex file.  
The toolchain is used to be delivered with the Arduino IDE and I advise to use the Arduino delivered toolchain. Basically not using these toolchain means you're on your own.  
In V3 the toolchain is downloaded based on a json file. This is functionality provided by the boards manager.
