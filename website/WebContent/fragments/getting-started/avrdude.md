Avrdude
=======

Well, not really...

Avrdude is a tool used to upload your sketch onto an avr based board. It is delivered as part of the Arduino IDE and probably will be part of the Arduino IDE as Arduino IDE uses this tool as well.

However it should be better to name this section "uploaders" as the Arduino Eclipse plugin also supports bosac (Teensy) and other upload protocols (like for uploading Yun over the network) or ESP8266.

But in Arduino world Avrdude is the best know uploader.
