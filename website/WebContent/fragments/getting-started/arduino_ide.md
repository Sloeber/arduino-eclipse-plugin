Arduino IDE
============
From the plugin's perspective there are 3 Arduino (IDE) versions.

V1 of sloeber uses the pre 1.5.x Arduino IDE.  
V2 of sloeber uses Arduino IDE 1.5.x up to 1.6.x (with many gaps)  
V3 of slober uses the Arduino formatted json files. As such the Arduino IDE as a installable package is no longer needed.
