	heading="How can I contact the author of this great plugin?">
<p>
	First of all ask yourself: <i>"Do I have something of interest to
		share with Jantje? I mean interesting for Jantje, not for me?"</i>. <br />
	Then consider asking yourself: <i>"Jantje has spent many days
		working on this plugin. Jantje is still spending way too much time on
		improving the plugin. Jantje gives it to you all for free. Do I really
		want to consume Jantje's time?"</i>.
</p>
<p>If you still believe you want to contact Jantje, please first try
	searching the web for an existing solution to your problem/question
	and, only after all the searches you could think of have failed, at
	least have the decency to write a proper email.</p>
<p>
	So don't be surprised when Jantje is not responding nicely when you ask
	a question you should not have asked him in the first place.<br /> If
	you think he's blunt, you should see the one-liner mails he gets!
</p>
<p>
	He's not the only person in the world who feels like this. So, before
	sending a mail, learn something and read the Eclipse guidance when
	formulating your question <b>note the Eclipse link is not a link to
		a help desk</b>. <a
		href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">It is a
		link to a document explaining how to ask questions the smart way.</a>
</p>
<p>
	Unless you want to send a mail saying <i>"thank you"</i> or <i>"well
		done"</i>, consider the following alternatives:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the Arduino forum to ask questions. There are 2 threads
		which have been going for a while and contain lots of info. Jantje
		actively monitors these threads.
		<ul>
			<li>Please post in <a
				href="http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,79595.0.html">this
					one</a></li>
			<li>Please <b>do not post</b> in <a
				href="http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,70547.0.html">this
					one</a>, but have a look at it nevertheless
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you think you have found a bug you can log the bug at <a
		href="https://github.com/jantje/arduino-eclipse-plugin"
		target="_blank">Github</a></li>
	<li>If you want to support/bribe Jantje, <a href="donate.html">buy
			him an Arduino</a>!
	</li>
	<li>If all of the above are not appropriate, then you want to
		discuss something in private with Jantje, which <b><i>you
				think</i></b> is really interesting to Jantje: you may reach him at <a
		href="mailto:eclipse@baeyens.it">eclipse@baeyens.it</a>.<br /> Note:
		If you want to increase your chanses of getting a nice answer, <a
		href="donate.html">buy him an Arduino</a>!
	</li>
</ul>

</accordion-group> <accordion-group heading="I want to support you. How can I do so?">
Thank you for wanting to support me. I really appreciate that.<br />
The best and only way to support me financially is <a
	href="https://www.patreon.com/jantje?ty=h">patreon.</a>
<br />
But you can also write/speak about the plugin. <br />
Or help with coding or this web site.<br />
</accordion-group> <accordion-group
	heading="I want to support you. What is your paypal account?">
Thank you for wanting to support me. I really appreciate that. However I
quit using paypal because I think many people think I earn lots of money
with this plugin. <br />
I started using patreon as it is clear to everyone how much I get. After
all this plugin is open (source)<br />
<br />
If you really want to support me why do you refuse to use patreon? Here
are some reasons for you to prefer patreon.<br />
If you encounter problems you will not get the same support as patreon
users as only patreon users can support issues.<br />
I'm currently looking at adding features to the plugin which will only
be available for patreon users.<br />
Patreon users have access to additional content on patreon.<br />
In general I pre-release Arduino eclipse related content- on Patreon.<br />
You can quit any time you want. No strings attached.<br />
<br />
Here are some reasons for me to prefer patreon.<br />
I have a more reliable income.<br />
I know/can identify the people who support me.<br />
I can keep "trolls" away from my video's (because you can only comment
on patreon).<br />
In other words it is good for my mental health and it keeps me going.<br />

</accordion-group> <accordion-group heading="On which versions is this plugin tested?">
<p>Due to machine changes, test setups have deteriorated: basically
	tests are now first done by developers and then by users.</p>
</accordion-group> <accordion-group heading="On which platforms is this plugin tested?">
<p>When I ask for testers I try to get a tester for each platform.
	As it is all volunteer work there are however no guarantees.</p>
<p>I designed/tested on RedHat and Windows XP.</p>
<p>There are windows users and there are some loyal Mac users whom I

</accordion-group> <accordion-group heading="Where is the serial monitor?">
From 1.2.2 onwards you can use the included serial monitor.<br />
Select menu item <code>
	<i>Windows &gt; Show View &gt; other &gt; Arduino &gt; Serial
		monitor View</i>
</code>.<br>
From V2 onwards press the <code>Serial monitor</code> icon in the
toolbar (the same as Arduino is using) or open it via the Arduino menu.<br>
There is no serial monitor in the tool before version 1.2.2: use the
serial monitor of your choice.<br>
</accordion-group> <accordion-group heading="Did you say there is a (oscillo)scope?">
Thanks to Wim Jongman version 2.1.1 introduced scope functionality. It
is a 6 channel scope that works exactly like <a
	href="http://www.negtronics.com/simplot">Simplot</a>
<br>
You can use the sample code from that site.<br>
Basically you can send any integer vallue to the scope. A good example
for debugging could be that you send the actual read value and the mean,
average, ...<br>
<a href="http://blog.baeyens.it/#post12">Here is a blog where I used

</accordion-group> <accordion-group heading="How do I debug?"> There is
no debug functionality with Arduino out of the box.<br>
The Arduino Eclipse plugin does support debugging with AVR dragon <a

From version 2.1.1 you can select to have a debug configuration in the

</accordion-group> <accordion-group heading="Where can I report bugs?">
Please report any bug on <a
	href="https://github.com/jantje/arduino-eclipse-plugin/issues"
	target="_blank">Github</a> providing as much information as possible
regarding how to reproduce it, your Eclipse environment configuration,
the operating system and the hardware you use when the issue occurs.<br>
</accordion-group> <accordion-group heading="I use AVRECLIPSE...">
<p>
	Great, excellent choice, a neat tool. V1 of this plugin uses
	AVRECLIPSE. The code from AVRECLIPSE has been forked and included in V1
	of this plugin. To avoid conflict between this plugin and AVRECLIPSE I
	had to change all the internal ID's of AVRECLIPSE. As a user you should
	not notice this unless you want to swap between AVRECLIPSE projects and
	Arduino Eclipse projects created with this plugin.<br> You may
	wonder whether it was a good idea to fork. Wouldn't it have been better
	to build on top like the plugin builds on top of CDT who builds on top
	of Eclipse.<br> I fully agree that this would have been better.
	New releases of AVRECLIPSE could have been applied without hassle.<br>
	It was the original idea but due to circumstances (there is no one to
	blame) it worked out differently.<br> My plugin adds amongst
	others: the create Arduino sketch, the add library, a preference page,
	a property page, a sample sketch to start from and the Arduino reset.<br>
</p>
<p>
	So basically when you installed V1 of this tool you have the AVRECLIPSE
	on your system. But what is the difference between AVRECLIPSE plugin
	and the AVRECLIPSE included in this plugin? <br>
<ol>
	<li>As mentioned above I had to change all the ID's.</li>
	<li>The AVRECLIPSE tool works with external tools like GCC and
		AVRDude. So does the Arduino IDE. When you set the option <code>use
			Arduino IDE tools in Eclipse</code> you actually set all the AVRECLIPSE
		settings to point to the Arduino tools. As all these tools are
		installed underneath the Arduino folder the plugin knows their
		location.
	</li>
	<li>I fixed some bugs. Each time a tool gets used in a different
		way some bugs will pop up. I fixed the ones that bothered me.</li>
	<li>I added the Arduino reset (still needed for the mega)</li>
</ol>
So unless I made a mistake and (as long as there is no newer AVRECLIPSE
version) you can use only my plugin to do project development on
non-Arduino and Arduino in the same environment.<br>
Note that as I only changed the ID's and not the names installing
AVRECLIPSE next to my plugin works but has the drawback that menu items
will appear twice and you can't tell them from each other.<br>
<br>
V2 removed AVRECLIPSE because due is no longer a AVR. The benefits of
using AVRECLIPSE no longer outweighed the drawbacks of having to support
SAM. This is actually very good news for people who need the full
AVRECLIPSE functionality as now you can run both at the same time
without drawbacks. </accordion-group> <accordion-group
	heading="How come is this plugin free?"> I have
written this tool for myself for several reasons.
<ul>
	<li>I lost plenty of time configuring the AVRECLIPSE plugin. As
		the configuration is per workspace I wanted something better.</li>
	<li>I truly believe the Arduino needs a software development
		growth path. Currently there is little available that would be a valid
		free software development growth path for the arduino.</li>
	<li>I had some time and wanted to learn more in depth about the
		Eclipse environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	As I build it and I did not feel like investing time to make money out
	of it I published the code in open source.<br> When I build the
	serial monitor I considered to make a commercial package from it. I
	decided not to do so because the price/support effort seemed out of
	balance at that time.<br> In July 2012 I added a <a
		href=";donate.html">Buy Jantje an Arduino.</a> page to allow people to
	sponsor this project. Results have been below expectations.<br>
	During this period my web stats reports a minimum per month of 3289
	visits; 5206 page views.<br> During the whole of the 3 first
	months I received 5 donations.<br> I'm not complaining but I'm
	looking for a way to convince myself to keep new versions of the plugin
	available and free. And it is getting harder and harder to convince
	myself.<br> The main reason is that there are plenty of people
	around who think: &quot;because Jantje gives away the code for free; he
	is my personal slave&quot;. In other words: I have to solve their
	problems and I am really rude if I refuse to do so. The result is that
	I spend time solving other peoples their problems or spend time getting
	rid of those people. In both cases my projects <b>for which I
		designed the plugin</b> are on hold.<br> On the non-money front: the
	<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=372807">CDT
		bug for which I asked to vote</a> reports 6 votes after 19 months. Today
	my Karma at the Arduino forum is 38.<br> Bottom line: Due to lack
	of return I feel I only loose time and money with this pugin.<br>
	I don't want to think about this, because if I do I quit on the spot.<br>
	<i>......(Jantje stopped thinking)</i><br> Update: The Arduino
	team has provided me with plenty of real Arduinos. I'm really pleased
	they have made those boards available to me. Mostly because I consider
	it as a recognition to my work by the core Arduino team.<br>
	Update 2: Some people jumped in with the development. Some hard to fix
	(for me) issues are now fixed for me too. Update 3: you can support me
	on Patreon. Support is now for patereon users only. Update 4: I'm
	planning to lock some new functionality for patreon only users.
