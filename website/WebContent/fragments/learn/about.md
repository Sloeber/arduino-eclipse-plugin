Why would you use the plugin named Sloeber
========
If you are starting with arduino or micro controllers in general I strongly advice to start using the arduino IDE. 

But when you get things going in the Arduino IDE and you start wondering "why can't I ..." about the arduino IDE you may have to level up and then the arduino eclipse plugin is a great way to continue your arduino growth path.

Why is that?

The arduino IDE put the focus on "a low entry level". Honestly with decades of experience in software development I can tell you -hand on hart- that the Arduino IDE is very good designed ... for it's purpose.

But when you start growing and "the low entry level" is no longer your first concern. You start to want a "rich tool", not a "this way it will work always work tool". So a tool that allows you to control more things, and as such does not stop you from breaking things.

As it is nearly impossible to combine a "rich tool" with a "low entry level tool" many "requests for improvements" are rejected by the arduino core team as it may infringe the "low entry level" target.

So when you have a need that goes above "low entry level" you are out of the focus of the arduino IDE development team and you need to start banging another door/tool.

At that point in time, one of the doors/options is the arduino eclipse plugin. One of the strong points of the Arduino eclipse plugin compared to the other available tools is that it is multi platform. It has active users using Windows, Mac and linux.

The arduino eclipse plugin is easy to set-up (though harder than the Arduino IDE) and easy to use. It has the same icons for verify upload and serial monitor as the arduino IDE.   
Most people have uploaded a sketch in less than 15 minutes -there are some people who never succeeded in running the tool-.
