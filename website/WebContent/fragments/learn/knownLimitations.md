Known Limitations
====
Just like in every software there are issues. But as Sloeber is an Arduino IDE replacement some issues are actually things that work in Arduino IDE and do not work in Sloeber.  
These issues are tagged as "known limitation" in github.  
Off-course we try to keep this list to a minimum but some things are just to hard to fix.  
You can find the full list here:
