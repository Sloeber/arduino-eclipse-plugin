Search functionality
=====
Eclipse offers lots of search functionality. There are specific C/C++, Java, text and many other simple search functionalities.  

There are next to these other search like the outline (normally to the right of the screen). If you set the option (click on the dropdown triangle) link with editor; a click on a method in the outline monitor will take you directly to the method in the code.  
 
When you hover over a method it will show you the implementation. If you write comments you'll see the implementation comments.

The call hierarchy browser tells you where a method/object is used and lets you jump to those locations. To open it right click the object of your interest and select "open call hierarchy"
